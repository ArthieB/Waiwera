Computational mesh
******************

.. description of mesh- FEM-style geometric mesh (not pure FV like TOUGH2)
.. mesh isn't in JSON file, but in auxiliary mesh file
.. add instructions on mesh preparation, supported mesh formats etc.

.. filename
.. 2D and radial models (radial, thickness)
.. zones
.. minc
.. assigning permeabilities to faces - by default direction, permeability angle, overriding (faces) - this should perhaps be in the rock section
