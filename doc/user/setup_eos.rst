Equation of state
*****************

.. list available equations of state
.. primary variables for each (need to know for specifying initial conditions, BCs?)
.. temperature for w eos (isothermal)
.. main functions of an EOS (phase transitions, bulk properties, phase properties, check primary variable bounds, primary variable scaling)
