Testing Waiwera

Unit tests
----------

Unit tests are lower-level tests of individual subroutines in the code. These are used mostly during code development, but may also be run to help verify that Waiwera has been installed correctly.

Unit tests are carried out using the `FRUIT <https://sourceforge.net/projects/fortranxunit/>`_ framework for Fortran unit testing, via a separate Python interface called `FRUITPy <https://github.com/acroucher/FRUITPy>`_. You will need to install both FRUIT and FRUITPy before running the unit tests.

Installing FRUIT and FRUITPy

Running unit tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run all unit tests , navigate to the main Waiwera directory and type::

  python unit_tests.py

It is also possible to run unit tests only for specific code modules, by listing the names of those code modules after the command above. For example, to test only the `IAPWS` module, type::

    python unit_tests.py IAPWS

or to test only the `face` and `cell` modules, type::

  python unit_tests.py face cell

If the tests have successfully passed, the output from FRUIT will appear something like this::

  All tests passed.
  Hit rate:
  asserts:  670 / 670 (100%)
  cases  :  86 / 86 (100%)

The precise numbers of asserts and cases will vary, depending on how many modules are being tested (and how many tests are included for the version of Waiwera you are running). If any tests fail, there will be output regarding which tests are not passing.

The tests will be repeated several times, using different numbers of processors each time (by default, using 1, 2, 3 and 4 processors). This can help show up any problems that occur only when running in parallel, or for specific numbers of processors.

Benchmark tests
---------------

These are higher-level tests of the code as a whole, running complete flow simulation problems and comparing results against reference results (analytical solutions or output from other simulators). They may also be run to help verify correct installation of Waiwera.

Benchmark tests are carried out using a modified verison of the CREDO testing framework, originally developed for the `Underworld <http://www.underworldcode.org/>`_ geodynamics simulator.
