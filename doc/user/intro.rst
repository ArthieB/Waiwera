What is Waiwera?
================

Waiwera is a parallel, open-source geothermal flow simulator. It features:

* numerical simulation of high-temperature subsurface flows, including robust phase changes
* parallel execution on shared- or distributed-memory computers and clusters
* use of `PETSc <https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/>`_ (Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation) for parallel data structures, linear and non-linear solvers, etc.
* standard file formats for input (`JSON <http://www.json.org/>`_) and output (`HDF5 <https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/HDF5>`_, `YAML <http://www.yaml.org/about.html>`_)
* structured, object-oriented code written in Fortran 2003
* free, open-source [license](license.md)

Waiwera was developed at the University of Auckland's `Geothermal Institute <http://www.geothermal.auckland.ac.nz/>`_. Initial development was part of the "Geothermal Supermodels" research project, funded by the NZ Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (`MBIE <http://www.mbie.govt.nz/>`_), with additional support from `Contact Energy Ltd <https://contact.co.nz/corporate>`_.
